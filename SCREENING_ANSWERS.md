**1. Please provide links to websites you've built for other businesses.**

Most relevant to your behavioral health project — Southfield Healthcare (https://southfield-healthcare.vercel.app), Tinnitus Therapy SaaS (https://tinnitus-therapy.vercel.app), and MedRecord AI (https://medrecord-ai-delta.vercel.app). I also built a working demo specifically for your redesign project: {VERCEL_URL}

**2. Include a link to your GitHub profile and/or website.**

GitHub: https://github.com/HumamAl — the demo built for your project is there too, if you want to see how it was structured: {VERCEL_URL}

**3. Describe your approach to testing and improving QA.**

Cross-browser and mobile-first responsive testing before any delivery, plus a HIPAA compliance audit pass on all form fields and third-party scripts to make sure no PHI leaks — the demo shows the approach: {VERCEL_URL}

Post-migration I run a full 301 redirect verification and monitor Search Console for coverage drops in the first 30 days to protect your SEO.

**4. Describe your recent experience with similar projects.**

Built Southfield Healthcare — a patient scheduling and management platform where HIPAA constraints shaped every workflow decision — and Tinnitus Therapy SaaS, a multi-clinic platform covering the full patient journey from intake to outcome tracking.

The demo I built for your behavioral health site shows how that experience translates to a Squarespace-to-WordPress redesign with compliant lead forms: {VERCEL_URL}
