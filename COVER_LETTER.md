Hi,

Squarespace-to-WordPress migrations for behavioral health sites have one non-negotiable: HIPAA-compliant lead forms that don't leak PHI through third-party scripts — I mocked up what your redesigned site could look like: {VERCEL_URL}

The demo shows service pages, a compliant intake form, and SEO-preserving URL structure — a creative direction before any WordPress code gets written.

Previously built Southfield Healthcare's ops platform and a multi-clinic therapy SaaS — both had patient data workflows where compliance shaped every UI decision.

Are you keeping your current service page structure or restructuring how therapy offerings are organized?

10-minute call or I can send a 2-slide migration plan — your pick.

P.S. I can also record a quick Loom walkthrough if that's easier.
